**Currency Converter App by Amol Sadare**

This project is the **updated and enhanced version of my Harvard University CS50 Final Project**, where I initially built a simple currency converter as part of my journey into programming fundamentals. While the CS50 version served as a great starting point, I wanted to transform it into something much more practical, visually appealing, and feature-rich — an application that could provide **real-time exchange rates, historical trends, and a smooth user experience** for anyone needing quick currency conversions.

The journey to this final version was far from straightforward. I explored and tested multiple APIs — **CurrencyAPI**, **ExchangeRate-API**, and **Open Exchange Rates** — each with their own strengths and limitations. Some offered simple integrations but lacked support for past historical rates. Others had limited currency coverage, making them unsuitable for users dealing with less common or emerging-market currencies. I wanted a solution that could give **both real-time and past exchange rates** while supporting **the widest possible range of currencies**, because my goal was to create a truly global tool. After weeks of testing and refining, I finally settled on **CurrencyAPI.com**, which provided the perfect balance: fast response times, access to past data, and coverage for an extensive list of global currencies.

The project’s features evolved to include **real-time conversion between dozens of global currencies**, a **historical exchange rate chart** for context, and a **clean, user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter**. I also implemented a **“Connect on LinkedIn” clickable link** directly inside the app, which makes it personal and gives users a way to reach out to me for feedback or collaboration. On the backend, the app handles API calls, error-checking, and dynamic data updates efficiently, ensuring the user sees accurate results every time.

One of the more challenging aspects of this project was handling the different **data structures and authentication methods** from each API provider I tested. Every switch meant rewriting portions of the code, adjusting how requests were made, and sometimes even rethinking the way data was parsed and displayed. But these challenges taught me the importance of **modular, maintainable code** that could adapt quickly to different data sources without breaking the entire application.

The final version you see today is the result of **iterative problem-solving, a willingness to experiment, and learning from roadblocks**. It’s fast, it’s reliable, and it’s genuinely useful. More importantly, it stands as a testament to my growth from my CS50 beginnings to now — where I can take an idea, break it down into components, and deliver a polished end product that’s ready for real-world use.
